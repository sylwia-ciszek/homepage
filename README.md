## About Me 
![Sylwia Ciszek](https://github.com/sylwia-ciszek/homepage/blob/main/images/moje_zdjecie.jpg?raw=true)

 Hi! My name is Sylwia and I'm from small willage in Poland. The most important thing about myself is that I'm mother of two kids and I work in geodesy public administration for 4 years. 
 In 2016 I finished first degree of ingeenering in geoinformatics at Wyższa Szkła Inżynieryjno-Ekonomiczna in Rzeszów. 
 You can ask: Why you start programming and creating pages if you study geoinformatics?
 I always enjoy work at computer. After high school I didn't really know what I should do in the future. My ideas was military, lawyer, graphic designer and many others that I don't even remember now. My choice lay on the geoinformatics because I didn't have any problems with math, informatics or phisics - and thoose were subjects most important in Geodesy. So, after few conversations with my parents I decide to study geoinformatics.
 
 ## Nowadays
 After 10 years from that decisions, lot have change. 
 As already mentioned I heve two kids. My paper work make me a little bit bored so I decided to do something new and fresh. In the march 2021 i find YouCode - online school of coding and here I am with my first page.
